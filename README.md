# **local-library-project**

## **Overview**
This is a Thinkful bootcamp project assignment to update the functions that help a "local library" webpage display properly.

## **JS Structure**
The program has three .js files: *home*, *books*, and *accounts*. Each of these scripts contains functions which help track different data sets within the local library in order to help users understand the current state of the library.
The following information is tracked using the JS scripts, which is then displayed on the local library webpage for user convenience:
* total number of books
* total number of accounts
* total number of books being borrowed
* most popular genres
* most popular books
* most popular authors

There are also functions that allow for a user to access particular information:
* total number of borrows for a given account
* all books borrowed by a given account
* an account returned depending on a given ID
* find a book given an ID
* find an author given an ID

Finally, some functions work in the background to organize the data being used:
* sorting accounts by last name
* partitioning books that are borrowed from those that aren't
